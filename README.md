# Project-CS3051 
<p> Computer Architecture <br>
Tasks:  <br>
• Implement the multi-cycle processor with the ISA from the HH book.  <br>
• Add hardware to support Floating Point multiplication 16bx16b FMUL, and a 8-bit shift register. <br>
• Simulate with an ASM program. Do not forget to modify memory to behave as byte-addressable. <br>
• Implement and test with Basys 3 board. Up to +6 points in E2. </p>
